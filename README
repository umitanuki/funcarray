funcarray - a set of functional array operations for PostgreSQL.

* maparray( anyarray, regproc( anyelement ) )
    returns anyarray
  This calls lambda function for each element of the array.
  The value returned from lambda is the element in the same position
  of the new array that will be returned as the result of maparray.

* reducearray( anyarray, regproc( anyelement, anyelement))
    returns anyelement
  This calls lambda function for each element of the array, to reduce
  them into a single value. The lambda accepts two arguments, one for
  the state value and the other for the new coming element.

* filterarray( anyarray, regproc( anyelement ) )
    returns anyarray
  This calls lambda function for each element of the array that
  returns boolean value taking the element as its only argument.
  If the returned boolean is true, the element will be still at the same
  position, whereas if the boolean is false then the element will be removed
  and its position will be filled by the subsequent elements.
